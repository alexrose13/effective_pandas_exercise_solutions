# Effective Pandas: Exercise Solutions
_Alexander Rose_
_April 4, 2022

## Welcome

This book—heavily inspired by [Jeffery B. Arnold's _R for Data Science: Exercise Solutions_](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/)—aims to accomplish a similar goal: provide an approach to the exercises contained within a beloved technical manual. In contrast to Arnold's work, this book focuses on [_Effective Pandas_ by Matt Harrison](https://hairysun.com/announcing-effective-pandas.html). 

_Effective Pandas_ is availabe as a [digtal book (pdf)](https://store.metasnake.com/effective-pandas-book) or as a physical book on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Pandas-Patterns-Manipulation-Treading/dp/B09MYXXSFM).

## Acknowledgements

In time, I hope that these solutions will benefit from many contributors. Until that time, a special thanks to:
* Matt Harrison [@mattharrison](https://github.com/mattharrison) for authoring such a thoughful manual.
* Ross Katz [@brk21](https://github.com/brk21) for suggesting _Effective Pandas_ to me as I was preparing to retool from R into Python.
