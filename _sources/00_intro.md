Author's Note: Aside from the fact that this is—among other things—an accountability exercise to assit me with my goal of working through this book in its entirety, this 'solutions guide' is currently in active development. That means that some of the 'solutions' posted here represent my current understanding at any given time rather than the 'correct' answer. If you identify a change that you would like to see reflected in this book, please get in touch. 

Please watch this space for future updates.

# Effective Pandas: Exercise Solutions
_Alexander Rose_

_April 4, 2022_

## Welcome

This guide—heavily inspired by [Jeffery B. Arnold's _R for Data Science: Exercise Solutions_](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/)—aims to accomplish a similar goal: provide an approach to the exercises contained within a beloved technical manual. In contrast to Arnold's work, this book focuses on [_Effective Pandas_ by Matt Harrison](https://hairysun.com/announcing-effective-pandas.html). 

_Effective Pandas_ is availabe as a [digtal book (pdf)](https://store.metasnake.com/effective-pandas-book) or as a physical book on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Pandas-Patterns-Manipulation-Treading/dp/B09MYXXSFM).

## Acknowledgements

In time, I hope that these solutions will benefit from many contributors. Until that time, a special thanks to:
* Matt Harrison ([github: @mattharrison](https://github.com/mattharrison) and [twitter: @__mharrison__](https://twitter.com/__mharrison__)) for authoring such a thoughful manual.
* Ross Katz ([github: @brk21](https://github.com/brk21) and [twitter: @brosskatz](https://twitter.com/brosskatz)) for suggesting _Effective Pandas_ to me as I was preparing to retool from R into Python.
